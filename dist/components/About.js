Since most of their business takes place online, many of Bruce's work hours were spent taking courses in Bootstrap, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and jQuery. With these new skills, Bruce began his journey into web development. In late 2018, he started training through a 9-month software engineering boot camp called Hack Reactor. The Hack Reactor program prepares coders for the real world of coding where problems are often difficult to understand and require planning, determination, and resourcefulness to solve. Bruce hopes to graduate from the Hack Reactor program in September 2019."))))),
