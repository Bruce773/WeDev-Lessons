He has since learned HTML, CSS, Arduino (a derivative of C++), and JavaScript. In 2015, Bruce founded a class called Pi Crafters that taught kids basic programming and electronic skills. In 5 months, kids learned how to construct a website, design circuits, and code robotic projects.<br>In 2017, Bruce started as an intern at Yoga International. Since most of their business takes place online, many of Bruce\'s work hours were spent taking courses in Bootstrap, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and jQuery. With these new skills, Bruce began his journey into web development. In late 2018, he started training through a 9-month software engineering boot camp called Hack Reactor. The Hack Reactor program prepares coders for the real world of coding where problems are often difficult to understand and require planning, determination, and resourcefulness to solve. Bruce hopes to graduate from the Hack Reactor program in September 2019.</p></div></div></div></div></div>'
